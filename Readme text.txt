At this time, the Ausxo Revival strictly supports the Windows (.exe) version only. This release is our primary focus so we can ensure stability, performance, and the best possible experience during the initial launch phase.

Support for iOS and Android is currently in development and will be released in the coming days. These versions require additional testing and optimization, which is why they are not available yet. We ask for your patience while we complete this process.

Please note that any other files, ports, or platforms claiming to be available at this time are not officially supported and may not be safe or functional. For your security, only download the game from our official sources.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support. More updates will be shared soon as development progresses.
